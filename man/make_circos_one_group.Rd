\usage{
make_circos_one_group(prioritized_tbl_oi, colors_sender, colors_receiver)
}
\arguments{
\item{prioritized_tbl_oi}{Subset of `prioritization_tables$group_prioritization_tbl`: the ligand-receptor interactions shown in this subset will be visualized: recommended to consider the top n LR interactions of a group of interest, based on the prioritization_score (eg n = 50; see vignettes for examples).}

\item{colors_sender}{Named vector of colors associated to each sender cell type. Vector = color, names = sender names. If sender and receiver cell types are the same, recommended that this vector is the same as `colors_receiver`.}

\item{colors_receiver}{Named vector of colors associated to each receiver cell type. Vector = color, names = sender names. Vector = color, names = sender names. If sender and receiver cell types are the same, recommended that this vector is the same as `colors_receiver`.}
}
\value{
a list with a circos plot for one group of interest, and a legend showing the color corresponding to each sender/receiver cell type.
