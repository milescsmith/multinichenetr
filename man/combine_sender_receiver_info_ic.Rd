\usage{
combine_sender_receiver_info_ic(sender_info, receiver_info, senders_oi, receivers_oi, lr_network)
}
\arguments{
\item{sender_info}{Output of `process_info_to_ic` with `ic_type = "sender"`}

\item{receiver_info}{Output of `process_info_to_ic` with `ic_type = "receiver"`}

\item{senders_oi}{Character vector indicating the names of the sender cell types of interest}

\item{receivers_oi}{Character vector indicating the names of the receiver cell types of interest}

\item{lr_network}{Prior knowledge Ligand-Receptor network (columns: ligand, receptor)}
}
\value{
List with data frames containing ligand-receptor sender-receiver combined expression information (see output of `get_avg_frac_exprs_abund` and `process_info_to_ic`)
}
\description{
\code{combine_sender_receiver_info_ic}  Link the ligand-expression information of the Sender cell type to the receptor-expression information of the Receiver cell type. Linking via prior knowledge ligand-receptor network.
