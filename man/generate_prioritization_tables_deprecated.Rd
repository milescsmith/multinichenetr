\arguments{
\item{sender_receiver_info}{Output of `combine_sender_receiver_info_ic`}

\item{sender_receiver_de}{Output of `combine_sender_receiver_de`}

\item{ligand_activities_targets_DEgenes}{Output of `get_ligand_activities_targets_DEgenes`}

\item{contrast_tbl}{Data frame providing names for each of the contrasts in contrasts_oi in the 'contrast' column, and the corresponding group of interest in the 'group' column. Entries in the 'group' column should thus be present in the group_id column in the metadata. 
Example for `contrasts_oi = c("'A-(B+C+D)/3', 'B-(A+C+D)/3'")`:
`contrast_tbl = tibble(contrast = c("A-(B+C+D)/3","B-(A+C+D)/3"), group = c("A","B"))`}

\item{sender_receiver_tbl}{Data frame with all sender-receiver cell type combinations (columns: sender and receiver)}

\item{grouping_tbl}{Data frame showing the groups of each sample (and batches per sample if applicable) (columns: sample and group; and if applicable all batches of interest)}

\item{fraction_cutoff}{Cutoff indicating the minimum fraction of cells of a cell type in a specific sample that are necessary to consider the ligand/receptor as expressed for the final prioritization.}

\item{abundance_data_receiver}{Data frame with number of cells per cell type - sample combination;  output of `process_info_to_ic`}

\item{abundance_data_sender}{Data frame with number of cells per cell type - sample combination; output of `process_info_to_ic`}

\item{ligand_activity_down}{For prioritization based on ligand activity: consider the max of up- and downregulation (`TRUE`, default) or consider only upregulated activity (`FALSE`).}
}
\value{
List containing multiple data frames prioritized senderLigand-receiverReceptor interactions (with sample- and group-based expression information), ligand activities and ligand-target links.
}
\description{
\code{generate_prioritization_tables_deprecated}  Perform the MultiNicheNet prioritization of cell-cell interactions. 
User can choose the importance attached to each of the following prioritization criteria: differential expression of ligand and receptor, cell-type-condition-specificity of expression of ligand and receptor, NicheNet ligand activity, fraction of samples in a group that express a senderLigand-receiverReceptor pair, relative cell type abundance of sender/receiver. The potential for the latter is deprecated.
