make_ligand_receptor_violin_plot(sce, ligand_oi, receptor_oi, sender_oi, receiver_oi, group_oi, group_id, sample_id, celltype_id, batch_oi = NA, background_groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment object}

\item{ligand_oi}{Character vector of name of the ligand of interest}

\item{receptor_oi}{Character vector of name of the receptor of interest}

\item{sender_oi}{Character vector with the names of the sender cell type of interest}

\item{receiver_oi}{Character vector with the names of the receiver cell type of interest}

\item{group_oi}{Character vector of name of the group of interest}

\item{group_id}{Name of the meta data column that indicates from which group/condition a cell comes from}

\item{sample_id}{Name of the colData(sce) column in which the id of the sample is defined}

\item{celltype_id}{Name of the meta data column that indicates the cell type of a cell}

\item{batch_oi}{Name of a batch of interest based on which the visualization will be split. Default: NA: no batch.}

\item{background_groups}{Default NULL: all groups in the group_id metadata column will be chosen. But user can fill in a character vector with the names of all gruops of interest.}
